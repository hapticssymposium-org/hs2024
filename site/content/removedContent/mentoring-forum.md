# New: IEEE Haptics Symposium Mentoring Forum

We all benefit from mentoring and networking to get started in our careers. For the 2022 conference, we are pleased to offer a new Mentoring Forum that will provide opportunities for students and postdoctoral researchers to connect with senior and early-career faculty, to participate in breakout group discussions about their research via an online forum, and to formulate a concrete plan of action for advancing their research and career goals.  

**Mentoring Forum Online Event (For accepted participants only): March 24, 2022 - ~~9 am to 12 pm~~ 9:30 am to 12:30 pm US Pacific Time (~~16:00 to 19:00~~ 16:30 to 19:30 UTC)**

**Submission Deadline: February 21, 2022**

Applications are invited from Students and Postdoctoral Researchers.

Applicants should submit a short 1-2 page extended abstract describing any of the following:

- Late-breaking/Preliminary research results
- Research idea or proposal
- Proposed study or device design
- Rejected paper and request for feedback 

These submissions will be reviewed in order to select participants, but not be archived or published.  Authors who were considering submitting to the previous Works-in-Progress session are especially invited to apply. 

## Submission
Submit your 1-2 page extended abstract via [Paperplaza](http://ras.papercept.net/conferences/scripts/start.pl) before the deadline.

All submissions should be a maximum of 2 pages in length, including references. Formatting instructions are available [here](http://ras.papercept.net/conferences/support/support.php). For authorsâ€™ convenience, the templates for technical papers can be downloaded in [Word](http://ras.papercept.net/conferences/support/word.php) or [Latex](http://ras.papercept.net/conferences/support/tex.php) format. Note that only the US Letter template will be accepted, and not the A4 template. Submission of a video is optional, but encouraged (when creating videos, both captions and voice overs should be included).

Submissions will undergo a single-blind review process. Acceptance criteria will be based on the novelty and the potential impact of the contribution as well as the potential benefits the applicants may receive from participation in the Mentoring Forum. The review report will be shared with the respective author of each submission.

Accepted submissions will not be included in the electronically distributed conference proceedings, and they will not be published in IEEE Xplore. Authors retain the full copyright.

## Format
Selected applicants will be invited to participate in an online event on **March 24**. Details regarding the event format can be found [here](/program/mentoring-forum).

<!--
In it, several break-out sessions will be organized and will run in parallel. The sessions will group papers belonging to similar research areas within haptics. Participants will have 5 minutes to present their contribution in a pitch presentation with slides (required). The remaining time will be devoted to interactive discussions. One senior and one early-career haptics researcher will lead the discussions in each breakout session.  Each participant will be aided in identifying a concrete plan of action for attaining their goals.  Participants will follow up by checking in with their mentors approximately 6 months after the event.
