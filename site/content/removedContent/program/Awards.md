## Awards
Two main awards were distributed at IEEE Haptics Symposium 2022 to honor top contributions in each of the main categories of publications: IEEE Transactions on Haptics Short Papers and IEEE Haptics Symposium Conference Technical Papers. Commendations were also conferred for outstanding reviewing of technical paper submissions. Given the virtual format of the conference, no awards were given for hands-on demonstrations.

The details of each award appear below. All winners were announced during the award ceremony portion of the [livestream event](https://youtu.be/hkRaVJbKHy8?t=8069) on March 22, 2022, which is also archived for online viewing. In addition to the listed monetary prizes, each winning team received a commemorative certificate by mail.

## Best IEEE Haptics Symposium Conference Technical Paper
39 contributions were published as technical papers. The IEEE Haptics Symposium 2022 Editor-in-Chief, Fernando Bello, nominated six papers for this award based on the strength of their reviews. The authors of all six papers submitted video presentations that are [available online](/program/VideoPresentations) and were shown in the [livestream event](https://youtu.be/hkRaVJbKHy8?t=8069).

A committee of three experts (Gregory Gerling, Yasemin Vardar, and Hiroyuki Shinoda) selected the award recipients based on their final manuscripts, any supplementary materials, and their 3-minute video presentations. The selection criteria considered and looked for a high degree of innovation and creativity, well-founded analytical support and/or experimental evidence, technical excellence, a strong potential contribution and impact on the field, and a high quality video presentation. In addition to the best paper, the committee selected one runner-up and one honorable mention.
