## Timeline

Late 2021 – Demo submissions open

**Monday, January 24, 2022** (11:59 pm Pacific Time) – Demo submission deadline

TBA – Demo acceptance notification

## Submission Method

Proposals for hands-on demonstrations should be submitted using [PaperPlaza](https://ras.papercept.net/conferences/scripts/start.pl).  

Each submission will include the following items:

* A title that succinctly describes the demonstration.
* An ordered list of authors (including first and last names), with an indication of who is the corresponding author.
* A 1 page PDF describing the hands on demonstration. This should use the [ieeeconf format](http://ras.papercept.net/conferences/support/support.php).
* Any special considerations that the conference organizers should be aware of. For example, extra space requirements in the demo area. 
* A video (required), see guidelines below.

Authors should submit a supplemental video that describes their demonstration, preferably with motivation for the work. 

Videos will be used for promotional purposes at the conference, and all videos will be compiled into a digest video that will be posted on the conference website and uploaded to YouTube to showcase current research in haptics. In consideration of this, please do not include any material in your video that you consider confidential.

When submitting a video, please follow these guidelines: 

Length: Up to 1 minute\
Size: up to 40 MB\
Format: This should be a common format (e.g. MP4). Authors should confirm that their video will play on a recent version of [VLC media player](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html) (cross platform) without the need to download additional codecs. 

## Review Process

Submissions will be reviewed by the Demos & Exhibits Co-Chairs to ensure all demos are of interest to conference attendees and free from commercial content.

## Publication

The submitted title, author list, 1 page PDF and image will be included in the electronic proceedings distributed to conference attendees, but not archived on IEEExplore.

## Demonstration Details

Demonstrations will be assigned to specific sessions in which authors are required to be near their demo table. 

We strongly recommend that demonstrators have two or more persons at their table during the session, to enable technical discussions to take place without having to pause the hands-on demo. If it is not possible to have more than one person present, then the demonstrator may contact the demo chairs in advance of the conference to request assistance from a student volunteer. 

Demonstrators are encouraged to bring a poster to accompany their demo.

Each demonstration will be assigned a space at the conference. The space will include a table, chairs, electrical power, and poster board.

## Logistics

More information for demonstrators, such as when demonstrations can be set up and need to be removed, will be made available closer to the date of the conference.

<!--
Each demo will be allocated a space that includes a 72" by 30" (183 cm by 76 cm) table, two chairs, one six-outlet power strip (120 V, 60 Hz, type B North America plugs), and a 8' by 4' (2.4 m by 1.2 m) board for mounting a poster. Demo presenters are invited to set up their demos on Saturday, March 28 after 7:00 p.m. Demos should be removed by 3:00 p.m. on Tuesday, March 31 (the last day of the conference).
