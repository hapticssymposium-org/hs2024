The 2020 IEEE Haptics Symposium banquet and dinner cruise will take place on the Potomac aboard the glass enclosed Odyssey DC.  This cruise drifts past landmarks of Washington D.C. such as the Jefferson Memorial, Georgetown waterfront, Old Town Alexandria, and National Harbor.

The banquet will take place in the evening on Monday, March 30th from 7 to 10 p.m.  Travel from the Crystal Gateway Marriott to the cruise launch site will be facilitated by a short (~2 mile, 20 minute) bus ride departing between about 6 and 6:30 p.m.  Student volunteers will help facilitate the boarding of both the bus and the cruise.  Further details will be provided nearer the conference but it is very important to make the buses, as the cruise will leave promptly at 7 p.m. and will not wait or return to shore.

Please remember to bring your banquet ticket, which is in your registration envelope.

The banquet will begin with cocktails, followed by a full dinner.
