IEEE Haptics Symposium features a diverse technical and social program to present your latest research and engage with the haptics community. 

The 2022 conference will be held in beautiful coastal California, on the campus of the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB), which is bordered by the sandy beaches of the Pacific Ocean.  Santa Barbara is 90 minutes north of Los Angeles.  It is served by the Santa Barbara Airport (SBA), by Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), and by several other Los Angeles area airports. 

Santa Barbara is a coastal city with a mediterranean climate.  It is situated on one of the longest and most beautiful coastlines in the United States.  The Santa Barbara area is rich in history, as evidenced by its characteristic Spanish Colonial architecture.  It was first inhabited 13,000 years ago, was subsequently inhabited by the Chumash Native American people, and was settled by Spanish colonialists in the 1700s.  Today, the city has a vibrant, pedestrian-accessible downtown that invites many tourists each year.

## **Accommodations and Transportation**

The conference will be held on the UCSB campus, a short bus, car, or train ride from Santa Barbara's city center, near Santa Barbara's sister town of Goleta.  There are many options for accommodation in hotels in Santa Barbara or Goleta, as well as short stay accommodations such as Air BNBs.

For those who wish to stay in the vibrant, pedestrian-friendly downtown Santa Barbara area, daily transportation from central downtown Santa Barbara to the conference venue at UCSB will be available.  Further information will be provided in the coming months.
