Select the "Haptics Symposium" Society, "Haptics 2024" Conference, and "Haptics 2024 Technical Papers" Track. 

## **Presentation and Publication**

All accepted technical papers will be presented orally in a podium presentation, either in a dual-track regular session or in a single-track featured session.

All accepted papers will be included in the electronically distributed conference proceedings and also published in IEEE Xplore.

Paper copyright will be transferred to the IEEE as part of the publication process.

Paper decisions will be announced in late December, and will also be available in [PaperPlaza](https://ras.papercept.net/conferences/scripts/start.pl).

## **Videos**

Authors of accepted Technical Papers are strongly encouraged to submit each of two types of video: (1) Supplemental Videos (providing information beyond what is included in the paper) and a (2) 30-second Preview Video, to be shared on social media. Submissions are optional, but strongly encouraged as a means of highlighting the paper to interested researchers, including those who may not attend the conference.

### Supplemental Videos

As in the past conferences, supplemental videos will be uploaded through the the PaperPlaza system and reviewed along with the paper. Videos of the accepted papers will be submitted for publication to IEEE Xplore and may be used to promote the conference. Authors who submitted videos together with their manuscript need not take any additional action beyond any edits that may be requested by the reviewers and editors.

#### Supplemental Videos Guidelines

* Format: .mp4 (mpeg-4))
* Length: up to 2 minutes
* Resolution: at least 480p (progressive scan)
* File size: up to 40 MB
* Address the accessibility requirements listed below (see [Video Accessibility](../accessibility/#video-accessibility))
* Final (but not initial) video submissions will need to include some simple additional files for IEEE Xplore compliance

### Preview Videos

Authors of accepted papers are invited to submit an optional 30-second preview video summarizing their contribution. The video will significantly increase the visibility of the research to the haptics community and beyond. The 30-second preview videos will be disseminated via social media, including the [IEEE Haptics Symposium YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1YjMwrg8Hk6uAtyWb62yAw) and may be used to promote the conference. These preview videos will not be published in IEEE Xplore. Preview videos provide symposium attendees with a chance to browse papers in advance.

## **Final Submission**

**The final submission deadline is January 22, 2024.**

All accepted technical papers will appear in this year’s Haptics Symposium proceedings, which will be distributed at the conference and submitted to IEEE Xplore.

We will be using the Conference Paper Management System of the Robotics and Automation Society (PaperPlaza) for the creation of the electronic conference program and the archival IEEE proceedings. As such, authors will work within the established infrastructure of the [PaperPlaza system](https://ras.papercept.net/). To minimize confusion, we have provided details below on how to submit your accepted conference technical paper content to PaperPlaza.

Specific questions regarding PaperPlaza should be sent to [ras.101@papercept.net](mailto:ras.101@papercept.net). General questions about the final submission of conference technical papers should be sent to the Publications Chair at [publications@hapticssymposium.org](mailto:publications@hapticssymposium.org). Urgent general questions should be sent to the Program Chair at [program@hapticssymposium.org](mailto:program@hapticssymposium.org) or the General Co-chairs at [chairs@hapticssymposium.org](mailto:chairs@hapticssymposium.org).

### Camera-ready Instructions

Please follow these instructions if your paper was submitted directly as a Technical Paper.

Refer to the PDF Accessibility and Video Accessibility guidelines detailed at [Guide to Inclusive and Accessible Submissions](../accessibility).

The corresponding author must submit the final camera-ready conference technical paper content to the “Technical Paper” track.

The corresponding author will receive a confirmation email that acknowledges receipt of the final submission. If there are any issues, PaperPlaza staff will contact the corresponding author.

* The title, author list, and keywords should be correct and final.
* The abstract for use in the conference program (limited to 750 characters or ~100 words) should be finalized. Note that the final abstract within the paper itself (pdf manuscript file) is allowed to exceed 750 characters.
* Author affiliations, required ethical statements for experiments with human subjects, and funding acknowledgements should be checked.
* The final camera-ready pdf manuscript file of up to 10 MB must be uploaded.
* Authors are requested to revise their manuscripts according to reviewer guidance.

### \*\*Supplemental Videos\*\*

As in the past conferences, supplemental videos will be uploaded through the ScholarOne Manuscripts system (Transactions on Haptics Short Journal Papers) or the PaperPlaza system (Technical Papers) and reviewed along with the paper. Videos of the accepted papers will be submitted for publication to IEEE Xplore and may be used to promote the conference.  Authors who submitted videos together with their manuscript need not take any additional action beyond any edits that may be requested by the reviewers and editors.

### Preview Videos (New for 2022; Optional, but strongly encouraged)

Authors of accepted papers are invited to submit an optional 30-second preview video summarizing their contribution. The video will significantly increase the visibility of the research to the haptics community and beyond. The 30-second preview videos will be disseminated via social media, including the \[IEEE Haptics Symposium YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1YjMwrg8Hk6uAtyWb62yAw) and may be used to promote the conference. These preview videos will not be published in IEEE Xplore.

### \*\*Preview Video Requirements\*\*

Please refer to the \[video instructions page](/presenting/video-instructions/).

{{<simpleAnchor "vid-accessibility">}}
### Video Accessibility

Providing alternative means of accessing information is valuable for people with sensory impairments and also enables engagement in a variety of contexts (e.g., if the video is muted). We request that authors utilize both written text and recorded narration to explain their videos. To support meeting participants with visual impairments, please describe all figures and images with sufficient detail so that their descriptions can be captured by closed captioning software.

For Supplemental Videos, authors should directly “burn” closed captions into the video due to technical limitations in IEEE Xplore. In other words, these captions are not provided as a text file, but rather as subtitles in the video itself (this is called “open captioning”, rather than “closed captioning”, because the captions are always visible).

If you have questions or need assistance with any of these activities, please reach out to the Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion Chairs <mailto:edi@hapticssymposium.org>.

## \\\*\\\*Presentation Instructions\\\*\\\*

One author from each technical paper will deliver the oral presentation in the time permitted. Further details will be provided at a later time.

All presentations will be delivered from the speaker's own laptop computer to ensure the correct appearance of the slides. Please bring any required video adapters.  Both HDMI and VGA connections will be available, as well as audio output.

Authors can determine their presentation room and time from the detailed conference program.  (We ask that authors check the schedule again once the conference has begun to ensure they have the most up-to-date information.)

Presenters should check the connection with the conference projection system during a break before the session in which they are presenting, making sure all videos play on the screen.  Our on-site technician will be able to assist you with any issues.

We ask that all presenters arrive for their session at least ten minutes before it begins, check in with the session chairs, and sit near the front of the room to facilitate the change between speakers.
