# Technical Papers in Conference Proceedings

We solicit technical papers that report original, novel, unpublished work relevant to all the scientific, technological, and application aspects of haptics.

## **Paper Format**

Technical papers should be prepared according to the formatting instructions available [here](http://ras.papercept.net/conferences/support/support.php){:target="_blank"}.

For authors' convenience, the templates for technical papers can be downloaded in [Word](http://ras.papercept.net/conferences/support/word.php){:target="_blank"} or [Latex](http://ras.papercept.net/conferences/support/tex.php){:target="_blank"} format. Note that only the US Letter template will be accepted, not the A4 template.

## **Paper Length**

Authors should aim for a technical paper length of 6 pages or less, including references and all other components of the paper.

1 or 2 extra pages (beyond 6 pages) may be added through a charge of $200 per page, paid during conference registration.

## **Author Names and Affiliations**

Submitted papers will be reviewed in single-blind manner.

Author names and affiliations should be specified in all technical papers.

## **Submission Due Date**

~~Monday, October 12, 2023~~ **Monday, October 23, 2023 (extended)** (11:59 p.m. AoE)

**Important Update:** Authors affected by time zone discrepancy please contact us by sending an email request to</br> [chairs@hapticssymposium.org](mailto:chairs@hapticssymposium.org) and [editors@hapticssymposium.org](mailto:editors@hapticssymposium.org).

## **Notification Date**

Wednesday, December 20, 2023

## **Submission Method**

All technical papers (with optional videos) should be submitted using [PaperPlaza](https://ras.papercept.net/conferences/scripts/start.pl){:target="_blank"} (submission system will be open one month prior to the deadline).  Select the "Haptics Symposium" Society, "Haptics 2024" Conference, and "Haptics 2024 Technical Papers" Track. 

## **Presentation and Publication**

All accepted technical papers will be presented orally in a podium presentation, either in a dual-track regular session or in a single-track featured session.

All accepted papers will be included in the electronically distributed conference proceedings and also published in IEEE Xplore.

Paper copyright will be transferred to the IEEE as part of the publication process.

Paper decisions will be announced in late December, and will also be available in [PaperPlaza](https://ras.papercept.net/conferences/scripts/start.pl){:target="_blank"}.

## **Videos**

Submission of videos is optional but strongly encouraged to help readers understand the paper.

Uploaded videos will be reviewed along with the paper.

Videos will be submitted for publication to IEEE Xplore and may be used to promote the conference.

Guidelines: format (mpeg 4, .mp4), length (up to 2 minutes), resolution (at least 480p progressive scan), and file size (up to 40 MB). Final (but not initial) video submissions will need to include some simple additional files for IEEE Xplore compliance.

<!--

### \*\*Supplemental Videos\*\*

As in the past conferences, supplemental videos will be uploaded through the ScholarOne Manuscripts system (Transactions on Haptics Short Journal Papers) or the PaperPlaza system (Technical Papers) and reviewed along with the paper. Videos of the accepted papers will be submitted for publication to IEEE Xplore and may be used to promote the conference.  Authors who submitted videos together with their manuscript need not take any additional action beyond any edits that may be requested by the reviewers and editors.

### \*\*Supplemental Video Requirements\*\*

{{<supplementalVideoList "Conf">}}

{{<simpleAnchor "preview-videos">}}
### Preview Videos (New for 2022; Optional, but strongly encouraged)

Authors of accepted papers are invited to submit an optional 30-second preview video summarizing their contribution. The video will significantly increase the visibility of the research to the haptics community and beyond. The 30-second preview videos will be disseminated via social media, including the \[IEEE Haptics Symposium YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1YjMwrg8Hk6uAtyWb62yAw) and may be used to promote the conference. These preview videos will not be published in IEEE Xplore.

### \*\*Preview Video Requirements\*\*

Please refer to the \[video instructions page](/presenting/video-instructions/).

{{<simpleAnchor "vid-accessibility">}}
### Video Accessibility

Providing alternative means of accessing information is valuable for people with sensory impairments and also enables engagement in a variety of contexts (e.g., if the video is muted). We request that authors utilize both written text and recorded narration to explain their videos. To support meeting participants with visual impairments, please describe all figures and images with sufficient detail so that their descriptions can be captured by closed captioning software.

For Supplemental Videos, authors should directly “burn” closed captions into the video due to technical limitations in IEEE Xplore. In other words, these captions are not provided as a text file, but rather as subtitles in the video itself (this is called “open captioning”, rather than “closed captioning”, because the captions are always visible).

If you have questions or need assistance with any of these activities, please reach out to the Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion Chairs <mailto:edi@hapticssymposium.org>.

## Final Submission

\*\*The final submission deadline is January 17, 2022.\*\*

All accepted technical papers will appear in this year's Haptics Symposium proceedings, which will be distributed at the conference and submitted to IEEE Xplore.

We will be using the Conference Paper Management System of the Robotics and Automation Society (PaperPlaza) for the creation of the electronic conference program and the archival IEEE proceedings.  As such, authors will work within the established infrastructure of the \[PaperPlaza system](https://ras.papercept.net).  To minimize confusion, we have provided details below on how to submit your accepted conference technical paper content to PaperPlaza.

Specific questions regarding PaperPlaza should be sent to <ras.101@papercept.net>. General questions about the final submission of conference technical papers should be sent to the Publications Chair at <publications@hapticssymposium.org>. Urgent general questions should be sent to the Program Chair at <program@hapticssymposium.org> or the General Co-chairs at <chairs@hapticssymposium.org>.

### Papers Submitted as Technical Papers

Please follow these instructions if your paper was submitted directly as a Technical Paper.

The authors are strongly encouraged to check their submissions for accessibility using the instructions provided under "PDF Accessibility" below. This step is not required, but will help your document reach the widest number of people.

The corresponding author must submit the final camera-ready conference technical paper content to the "Contributed Papers" track.

The corresponding author will receive a confirmation email that acknowledges receipt of the final submission.  If there are any issues, PaperPlaza staff will contact the corresponding author.

\* The title, author list, and keywords should be correct and final.
\* The abstract for use in the conference program (limited to 750 characters or \~100 words) should be finalized.  Note that the final abstract within the paper itself (pdf manuscript file) is allowed to exceed 750 characters. 
\* Author affiliations, required ethical statements for experiments with human subjects, and funding acknowledgements should be checked.
\* The final camera-ready pdf manuscript file of up to 10 MB must be uploaded.
\* Authors are requested to revise their manuscripts according to reviewer guidance.
\* Authors may optionally upload a final camera-ready video file. Please see the "Video" section for more details.
\* IEEE requires a plain text Readme file of up to 10 kB for any accompanying multimedia content, such as video. The Readme file must contain (1) An overall description of the video file, (2) Multimedia player information, and (3) Author contact information.
\* IEEE requires a plain text Summary file of up to 10 kB for multimedia content.  The Summary file must describe in 5 sentences or less the contents of the video. This file helps IEEE Xplore users to make downloading decisions.

### Papers Submitted as ToH Short Papers

Please follow these instructions if your paper was rejected by the IEEE Transactions on Haptics but accepted as a Technical Paper.

\*\*Step 1)\*\* The submitting author must submit an “initial” conference technical paper placeholder to the “Contributed Papers” track.

\* The submitting author will need the title, author list, PaperPlaza PIN numbers of \*all\* authors, and keywords.
\* At this time an abstract is not required, but authors may wish to upload an abstract since it will be required before final submission. The abstract must be limited to 750 characters (\~100 words) and will be required for use in the conference program.  The final abstract within the pdf manuscript file is allowed to exceed 750 characters. 
\* A pdf manuscript will not be required at this stage, although authors may wish to upload their original manuscript as a placeholder.  The pdf file size is limited to 10 MB.

\*\*Step 2)\*\*  The corresponding author will receive a confirmation email that acknowledges receipt of the initial submission.

\*\*Step 3)\*\*  Shortly after the deadline for initial submission, the corresponding author will receive a confirmation email that acknowledges acceptance of the technical paper for oral presentation. At this time, PaperPlaza will be open for the submission of final camera-ready conference technical papers via what is labelled as the "IEEE Trans. Haptics Contributed Paper" track in PaperPlaza.

\*\*Step 3.5)\*\* The authors are strongly encouraged to check their submissions for accessibility using the instructions provided under "PDF Accessibility" below. This step is not required, but will help your document reach the widest number of people.

\*\*Step 4)\*\* The corresponding author must submit the final camera-ready conference technical paper content to the "IEEE Trans. Haptics Contributed Paper" track.

\*\*Step 5)\*\*  The corresponding author will receive a confirmation email that acknowledges receipt of the final submission.  If there are any issues, PaperPlaza staff will contact the corresponding author.

\* The title, author list, and keywords should be correct and final.
\* The abstract for use in the conference program (limited to 750 characters or ~100 words) should be finalized.  Note that the final abstract within the paper itself (pdf manuscript file) is allowed to exceed 750 characters. 
\* Author affiliations, required ethical statements for experiments with human subjects, and funding acknowledgements should be checked.
\* The final camera-ready pdf manuscript file of up to 10 MB must be uploaded.

### PDF Accessibility

We strongly encourage authors to check and annotate their PDFs for accessibility before final submission. Having accessible materials, including features like alt-text for figures and choosing colours to be distinguishable when viewed in black and white or with a form of colour-blindness, will help ensure that more people are able to review your submissions and read any published work.

The quickest way to do this is to follow one of the following resources to add alt-text and tagging to your documents:

\* \[SIGACCESS guidelines on creating accessible PDFs in Microsoft Word](http://www.sigaccess.org/welcome-to-sigaccess/resources/acm-submission-with-ms-word/)
\* \[Adobe's Accessible PDF Author Guide (best for LaTeX submissions)](http://www.sigaccess.org/welcome-to-sigaccess/resources/accessible-pdf-author-guide/)

If you have any questions, please contact the EDI chairs at \[edi@hapticssymposium.org](mailto:edi@hapticssymposium.org). Many additional resources can be found from the comprehensive instructions described by the ACM CHI community: \[https://chi2021.acm.org/for-authors/presenting/papers/guide-to-an-accessible-submission](https://chi2021.acm.org/for-authors/presenting/papers/guide-to-an-accessible-submission)

## \\\*\\\*Presentation Instructions\\\*\\\*

One author from each technical paper will deliver the oral presentation in the time permitted. Further details will be provided at a later time.

All presentations will be delivered from the speaker's own laptop computer to ensure the correct appearance of the slides. Please bring any required video adapters.  Both HDMI and VGA connections will be available, as well as audio output.

Authors can determine their presentation room and time from the detailed conference program.  (We ask that authors check the schedule again once the conference has begun to ensure they have the most up-to-date information.)

Presenters should check the connection with the conference projection system during a break before the session in which they are presenting, making sure all videos play on the screen.  Our on-site technician will be able to assist you with any issues.

We ask that all presenters arrive for their session at least ten minutes before it begins, check in with the session chairs, and sit near the front of the room to facilitate the change between speakers.
