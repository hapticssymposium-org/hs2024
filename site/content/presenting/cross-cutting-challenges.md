# Cross-Cutting Challenges Themes
Coming soon...
<!--
Following its successful launch at the 2018 Haptics Symposium, the Cross-Cutting Challenges (CCC) submission category will be held again at the 2022 Haptics Symposium.The goal of the set of CCC sessions is to come together to focus on interdisciplinary challenges (“themes”) calling for united solutions from the haptics community. Drawn from an open solicitation, two themes will feature keynote talks and interactive discussions delivered by experts from science, engineering, and design. 

## Cross-Cutting Challenge Theme Proposals

**Wednesday, September 22, 2021** (11:59 pm Pacific Time) - Theme Proposal deadline

A theme is an interdisciplinary challenge calling for united solutions from the haptics community. The themes are solicited from the community of researchers in the field of haptics and beyond.  While the traditional three areas covered in haptics relate to science, technology and applications, the themes for the Cross-Cutting Challenges session will be selected such that researchers from each of the aforementioned areas can present in the same session. For example, a theme might relate to a next generation of mobile user interfaces, and include elements from those working on surface haptics and shape and surface conformable displays, those working on the measurement of finger pad skin properties to surface interaction, those working on new dielectric polymer technologies, and those working on human computer interaction concepts detailing how a consumer would utilize such capability.  Other themes might relate to soft and flexible touch interfaces, ubiquitous computing, medical user interfaces, gaming, and mixed, virtual, and/or augmented reality. Examples of themes from 2018 and 2020 can be found at the following websites: \
https://2020.hapticssymposium.org/program/ \
http://2018.hapticssymposium.org/ccc1  \
http://2018.hapticssymposium.org/ccc2

**Submission Format:** Specify (as a single PDF document) the theme title, the organizer(s) (from one to three), and up to 500 words regarding the details mentioned below of how that topic is important to society and involves multiple disciplines.  Email your submission to <mailto:ccc@hapticssymposium.org>

**Themes:** Two themes will be selected by a committee drawn from both academia and industry. Proposals should thus be written to have a broad reach.  In addition, a non-disciplinary title should be selected.  The text should describe:

* Recent prior work: synthesize developments in the theme area over a period of years, multiple research teams, and multiple technical disciplines
* Current work: relate ongoing work to the arc of research in the theme area
* Future ideas: envision forward-looking, emerging directions requiring interdisciplinary teams

There is no need to form a team. That said, the proposal should provide the names of possible presenters, though it is not certain that these will be the final presenters, and you may not have even spoken to them about presenting.  The idea is to show that people exist who could contribute to the proposed theme.  It is also highly desired that topics span countries and even continents.  

Furthermore, each theme session will ultimately involve about ten presentations, several of which are expected to be given by engineers.  That said, two required presenter roles – outside the typical expertise of engineers – should be clearly delineated.   

* Role 1 (Human interface): A human computer interaction, human factors, or similar type of designer who is focused on the experience to be created for real end user.  (Required)
* Role 2 (Real end user): A person who is a domain expert and a real end user, such as a physician, nuclear reactor operator, physiologist, graphic designer, or video gamer.  (Required)

Two other roles are highly recommended:

* Role 3 (Contextual history): An experienced expert from within the field who in the capacity of this theme would provide overview of the history of technologies and efforts related to the theme.  This person’s presentation will also avoid the presentation of overlapping background by multiple presenters coming after him or her.  (Suggested but not required)
* Role 4 (Industry): An industry person who is interested and currently engaged in activities that are in some way related to the theme topic.  (Suggested but not required)

**Selection Committee:** The selection committee for Themes Proposals consists of three academic members, the Cross-Cutting Challenges Chairs, one conference chair, and three representatives from industry.  The three academic members will be chosen by the Cross-Cutting Challenges Chairs to represent haptic science, applications, and technology. Company representatives will be invited to the committee by the Cross-Cutting Challenges Chairs; industry participants hold an important role in the planning stages to ensure that selected grand challenges have the prospect for commercial and social benefit.

**Keynote and Interactive Discussion Submission Instructions:** Once the themes are selected and announced, individual keynote and interactive discussion proposals will be accepted in each of the two chosen theme areas.  The theme organizer will automatically be a keynote speaker, unless he or she for some reason chooses otherwise.

Investigators apply to deliver keynote talks (4 to 5 per theme session) and interactive discussions (about 10 per theme session).  Those submitting must be a faculty member and/or independent researcher, i.e., holding a Ph.D. degree or equivalent.  Note that while theme organizers may want to encourage particular individuals to submit, the selection of individuals within a theme will ultimately be based on finding a representative and coherent cohort of presenters that together create a powerful narrative and inspiring call to action.

**Keynote Talks:** Each keynote talk should synthesize research performed by the presenter (perhaps 3 journal articles and 2 conference papers published over the past few years), and it should be framed in light of the on-going grand challenge as well as the work of others in the field.  Specifically, talks should cover the following three components oriented around the cross-cutting challenge theme: 1) related prior work of this investigator done in the last 4-5 years, 2) present work that is in the process of being published in conferences and journals, and 3) forward-looking, emerging directions that the presenter sees as opportunities within this sub-domain.  Adequate time should be devoted to each.  Each talk will be sequenced appropriately by the organizers and Cross-Cutting Challenges Chairs, and the chosen presenters are expected to coordinate somewhat to craft a coherent message.  Speakers should not assume a lay audience, but should dive into the details in presenting work done in their lab.  

**Interactive discussions:** These contributions center around a poster and/or videos and may be led by an independent researcher with support from one or more other researchers from their team.  Interactive discussions should cover some of the same type of content as a keynote talk.  Proposers should aim to talk a large number of conference participants, so that personal and one-on-one discussions, idea generation and future team formation might be sparked during this session. To apply for interactive discussions, please submit your proposal to the organizers of the respective CCC after the selected CCC themes are announced.

**Selection Committee:** The selection committee for Keynote Talks and Interactive Discussions consists of three academic members, the Cross-Cutting Challenges Chairs, one conference chair, and that theme’s organizers.  The three academic members will be chosen by the Cross-Cutting Challenges Chairs to represent haptic science, applications, and technology.
